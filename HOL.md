<a name="Objectives" />
### Objectives ###

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to:

1. Use the Windows Azure Portal to create a Sharepoint Image.
1. Connect two virtual machines to the same cloud service for network connectivity.
1. Create and Configure SharePoint Server Farm.

<a name="Prerequisites" />
### Prerequisites ###

The following is required to complete this hands-on lab:

- Complete the _Deploying Active Directory_ HOL
- Complete the _Deploying SQL Server for SharePoint_ HOL
- [Windows Azure PowerShell CmdLets](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj156055)
- A Windows Azure subscription - [sign up for a free trial](http://aka.ms/WATK-FreeTrial)

<a name='gettingstarted' /></a>
### Getting Started: Obtaining Subscription's Credentials ###

In order to complete this lab, you will need your subscription’s secure credentials. Windows Azure lets you download a Publish Settings file with all the information required to manage your account in your development environment.

<a name='GSTask1' /></a>
#### Task 1 - Downloading and Importing a Publish-settings File ####

> **Note:** If you have done these steps in a previous lab on the same computer you can move on to Exercise 1.


In this task, you will log on to the Windows Azure Portal and download the publish-settings file. This file contains the secure credentials and additional information about your Windows Azure Subscription that you will use in your development environment. Therefore, you will import this file using the Windows Azure Cmdlets in order to install the certificate and obtain the account information.

1.	Open Internet Explorer and browse to <https://windows.azure.com/download/publishprofile.aspx>.

1.	Sign in using the **Microsoft Account** associated with your **Windows Azure** account.

1.	**Save** the publish-settings file to your local file system.

	![Downloading publish-settings file](Images/downloading-publish-settings-file.png?raw=true 'Downloading publish-settings file')

	_Downloading publish-settings file_

	> **Note:** The download page shows you how to import the publish-settings file using the Visual Studio Publish box. This lab will show you how to import it using the Windows Azure PowerShell Cmdlets instead.

1. Search for **Windows Azure PowerShell** in the Start screen and choose **Run as Administrator**.

1.	Change the PowerShell execution policy to **RemoteSigned**. When asked to confirm press **Y** and then **Enter**.
	
	<!-- mark:1 -->
	````PowerShell
	Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
	````

	> **Note:** The Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet enables you to determine which Windows PowerShell scripts (if any) will be allowed to run on your computer. Windows PowerShell has four different execution policies:
	>
	> - _Restricted_ - No scripts can be run. Windows PowerShell can be used only in interactive mode.
	> - _AllSigned_ - Only scripts signed by a trusted publisher can be run.
	> - _RemoteSigned_ - Downloaded scripts must be signed by a trusted publisher before they can be run.
	> - _Unrestricted_ - No restrictions; all Windows PowerShell scripts can be run.
	>
	> For more information about Execution Policies refer to this TechNet article: <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176961.aspx>


1.	The following script imports your publish-settings file and generates an XML file with your account information. You will use these values during the lab to manage your Windows Azure Subscription. Replace the placeholder with the path to your publish-setting file and execute the script.

	<!-- mark:1 -->
	````PowerShell
	Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile '[YOUR-PUBLISH-SETTINGS-PATH]'   
	````

1. Execute the following commands and take note of the Subscription name and the storage account name you will use for the exercise.

	<!-- mark:1-3 -->
	````PowerShell
	Get-AzureSubscription | select SubscriptionName
	Get-AzureStorageAccount | select StorageAccountName 
	````

1. If the preceding command do NOT return a storage account, you should create one first.
  
	1. Run the following command to determine the data center to create your storage account in. Ensure you pick a data center that shows support for PersistentVMRole. 

		````PowerShell
		Get-AzureLocation  
		````

	1. Create your storage account: 


		````PowerShell
		New-AzureStorageAccount -StorageAccountName '[YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-NAME]' -Location '[DC-LOCATION]'
		````

1. Execute the following command to set your current storage account for your subscription.

	<!-- mark:1 -->
	````PowerShell
	Set-AzureSubscription -SubscriptionName '[YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-NAME]' -CurrentStorageAccount '[YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT]'
	````

<a name="Exercise1" />
### Exercise 1: Creating SharePoint Image ###

You will now create the SharePoint Server disk image required to run this hands-on lab.

Make sure you have this image created before starting with the lab.	

<a name="Ex1Task1" />
#### Task 1 - Create a SharePoint virtual machine from an image using PowerShell####

In this task, you will create a SharePoint virtual machine from an image using PowerShell and we will join it to the domain we created in Deploying Active Directory hands-on lab. You will later use this virtual machine to configure the SharePoint Farm.

1. Navigate to the [Windows Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) using a web browser, and sign in using your Microsoft account.

1. If you do not have the IP address of the Domain Controller Virtual Machine, Navigate to the **Windows Azure Portal** using a Web browser and sign in using the **Microsoft Account** associated with your Windows Azure account.

1. Go to **Virtual Machines**, select the virtual machine where you deployed the active directory and select the **Connect** button at the bottom panel.

1. In the virtual machine, go to **Start**, type **cmd** and press **ENTER**.

1. Type **ipconfig** and press **ENTER**. Take note of the **IPv4 address**, you will use it later on this exercise. 

1. Close the **Remote Desktop** connection.

1. Click **NETWORKS** in the left pane. Select the desired **Virtual Network** and copy its Affinity Group name. You will use this name later, to create the new Virtual Machine.

	![Virtual Networks](Images/virtual-networks.png?raw=true "Virtual Networks")
	
	_Virtual Networks_	

1. Open **Windows Azure PowerShell** from **Start** | **All Programs** | **Windows Azure** | **Windows Azure PowerShell**, right-click **Windows Azure Powershell** and choose **Run as Administrator**.

1. Execute the following command to obtain the names of the available OS Disk images. Take note of the **SharePoint** image disk name you created in the **Getting Started** section of this lab.

	<!-- mark:1 -->
	````PowerShell
	Get-AzureVMImage | Select ImageName
	````

	![Image Name list](Images/image-name-list.png?raw=true "Image Name list")

	_Image Name list_

1. Copy the SharePoint Image name and execute the following command to define the Operating System disk image name for the new Virtual Machine. In this case we are going to use _c6e0f177abd8496e934234bd27f46c5d__SharePoint-2013-Trial-4-13-2013_ but it may defer when running the Lab.
	
	````PowerShell
	$imgName = 'c6e0f177abd8496e934234bd27f46c5d__SharePoint-2013-Trial-4-13-2013'
	````

1. Set up the virtual machine's DNS settings. To do this, you will use the Virtual Machine you created in _Deploying Active Directory_ HOL. Replace the placeholders before executing the following command. Use the IP address you took note at the beginning of the exercise.
	
	````PowerShell
	$advmIP = '[AD-IP-ADDRESS]'
	$advmName = '[AD-VM-NAME]'
	# Point to IP Address of Domain Controller Created Earlier
	$dns1 = New-AzureDns -Name $advmName -IPAddress $advmIP
	````

1. Set up the two virtual machine's configuration settings to automatically join the domain in the provisioning process. Before executing the command, replace the placeholders with the administrator and domain passwords.

	````PowerShell
	$vmName1 = 'spvm1'
	$vmName2 = 'spvm2'
	$adminUserName = '[ADMIN-USER-NAME]'
	$adminPassword = '[YOUR-PASSWORD]'
	$domainPassword = '[YOUR-PASSWORD]'
	$domainUser = 'administrator'
	$FQDomainName = 'contoso.com'
	$subNet = 'Subnet-1'
	# Configuring VM to Automatically Join Domain
	$spvm1 = New-AzureVMConfig -Name $vmName1 -InstanceSize Small -ImageName $imgName | 
				Add-AzureProvisioningConfig -WindowsDomain -AdminUserName $adminUserName -Password $adminPassword `
				-Domain 'contoso' -DomainPassword $domainPassword `
				-DomainUserName $domainUser -JoinDomain $FQDomainName |
		 Set-AzureSubnet -SubnetNames $subNet
	$spvm2 = New-AzureVMConfig -Name $vmName2 -InstanceSize Small -ImageName $imgName | 
				Add-AzureProvisioningConfig -WindowsDomain -AdminUserName $adminUserName -Password $adminPassword `
				-Domain 'contoso' -DomainPassword $domainPassword `
				-DomainUserName $domainUser -JoinDomain $FQDomainName |
		 Set-AzureSubnet -SubnetNames $subNet
	````

	>**Note:** The previous command asumes that you used the proposed names for the Domain Name and the Subnets that are shown in the **Deploying Active Directory** hands on lab. You may need to update the values if you used different names.

1. Create two Virtual Machine using the Domain and DNS settings you defined in the previous steps. Replace the placeholder with a unique Service Name.

	````PowerShell
	$serviceName = '[YOUR-SERVICE-NAME]'
	$affinityGroup = 'adag'
	$adVNET = 'domainvnet'
	# New Azure VM with VNET and DNS settings
	New-AzureVM –ServiceName $serviceName -AffinityGroup $affinityGroup `
									-VMs $spvm1, $spvm2 -DnsSettings $dns1 -VNetName $adVNET
	````

	>**Note**: Make sure the location specified matches the location of the storage account you've configured in the Getting Started section. Also make sure that the service name is available to create the dns of the virtual machine.

1. Once the provisioning process finish, connect to the virtual machine using Remote Desktop and verify if it was automatically joined to your existing domain. To do so, open server manager and verify that the machine is joined to the domain.

		>**Note**: The server farm account is used to create and access your configuration database. It also acts as the application pool identity account for the SharePoint Central Administration application pool, and it is the account under which the Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Workflow Timer service runs. The SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard adds this account to the SQL Server Login accounts, the SQL Server dbcreator server role, and the SQL Server securityadmin server role. The user account that you specify as the service account must be a domain user account, but it does not need to be a member of any specific security group on your front-end Web servers or your database servers. We recommend that you follow the principle of least privilege and specify a user account that is not a member of the Administrators group on your front-end Web servers or your database servers.
